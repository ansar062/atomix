# 🧬 Atomix

**Atomix** is a next-generation styling library that fuses the power of three dominant styling paradigms:

- ⚡️ Utility-first (like Tailwind CSS)
- 🧱 Component-based (like MUI)
- 🎨 CSS-in-JS (like Styled Components)

> Choose your own styling adventure — utility classes, pre-built components, or fully customizable CSS-in-JS.
